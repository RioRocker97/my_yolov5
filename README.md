# IOT-project for counting product
This project's goal is to integrated YOLO object detection into my basic GUI python-based program for counting product .

This is part of the final project of computer engineering at Thammsart University.

## Progression Note
- 22/11/2020
    - already train solid model for specific task(3 cap type + 1 unknows)
    - Try to modify detect.py in order to work with mygui.py (kinda hard)
    - very lazy implementation (do what minimum)
- 26/11/2020
    - understanding Threading in YOLOv5
    - try to use threading in order to save detected image to some specific location
    - lazy implementation (do what it should)
- 27/12/2020
    - look into detect.py again so i would modify it to be used with mygui.py
    - new feature proposal (count,live video feed in 1 Giant GUI)
    - exploring Machine learning and essentail library to complete this project
    - i have no idea how to do next step 
    

## New File Location

- Base_DIR\retrain : for saving images and labels for detected image
